# Assignment Two  
This repository contains solutions for two tasks from Module 3: Control Structures in Python. The program is written in two Python files, Task 1 and Task 2.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd  
The program prompts the user to enter an integer. It then checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement and displays the result.

### Sample Input/Output  
```sh
Enter an integer: 7  
7 is an odd number.
``` 

```sh
Enter an integer: 10  
10 is an even number.
``` 

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop  
The program uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50 and calculates the sum of all these integers. The final result is displayed at the end.

### Sample Output  
```sh
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
